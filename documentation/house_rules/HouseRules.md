# Yu-Gi-Oh Custom House Rules
Version: 1.0.0

The following are a list of rules that we have agreed upon for our Yu-Gi-Oh duels. Rules are subject to change (Especially when Tyler pulls some bullshit).

---

## Rule 0: Deck Sizes
- Main Deck
    - Must be between (40) and (60) cards.
- Side Deck (Optional)
    - Must be less than or equal to (15) cards.
- Extra Deck (Optional)
    - Must be less than or equal to (15) cards.

## Rule 1: Beginning of a Duel
- Before a duel begins, you may (but are not forced to) offer to have your opponent cut your deck. They can accept, or they can refuse. 
- Before cards are drawn or activated, it is common courtesy to show your opponent the bottom card of your deck. 
- At the beginning of each duel, each player starts with five cards in their hands. 
    - Unlike modern Yu-Gi-Oh, the starting player also draws one card for their first turn.
- Before any cards are activated, each duelist is allowed to mulligan their cards back into their deck, shuffle, and redraw five cards. Limit of one per duel.
- There is no maximum hand size. While standard Yu-Gi-Oh limits the hand to a size of 7, that is not required here.

## Rule 2: Forbidden Card Types
In general, all card types up to XYZ monsters are allowed for use in a standard duel. We do not allow for:
- Pendulum Monsters (In the Pendulum Zones)
    - We do allow for Pendulum Monsters, but only as Effect monsters.
- Link Monsters

## Rule 3: Monster Zones
We do not utilize Extra Monster zones, nor do we limit the summoning of monsters from the Extra Deck.

## Rule 4: Forbidden + Limited Lists
