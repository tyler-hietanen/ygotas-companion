# Yu-Gi-Oh Custom House Rules
Version: 1.0.0

The following are a list of house rules that have been agreed upon for our Yu-Gi-Oh duels. Rules are subject to change (Especially when Tyler pulls some bullshit).

---

## Rule 0: Deck Sizes
- Main Deck
    - Must contain between (40) and (60) cards.
- Side Deck (Optional)
    - Must contain less than or equal to (15) cards.
- Extra Deck (Optional)
    - Must contain less than or equal to (15) cards.

## Rule 1: Beginning of a Duel
- Before a duel starts, the duelist may (but are not forced to) offer the opponent the option to cut the duelist's deck. The opponent does not have to accept.
- Before cards are drawn or activated, it is common courtesy to show the bottom card of the duelist's deck to the opponent.
- At the beginning of each duel, each duelist starts with five cards in their hand. 
    - Unlike modern Yu-Gi-Oh, the starting player also draws one additional card for their first turn - they do not skip their draw phase.
- Before any cards are activated in each duelist's first turn, each duelist is allowed to mulligan their entire hand back into their deck, shuffle, and redraw five cards. 
    - Limit of one per duel.
- There is no maximum hand size. While standard Yu-Gi-Oh limits the hand to a size of 7, that is not enfoced.

## Rule 2: Forbidden Card Types
In general, all standard card types up to XYZ monsters are allowed for use in a standard duel. The following types are not allowed:
- Pendulum Monsters (In the Pendulum Zones)
    - Pendulum Monsters, as *Effect* monsters only, are tentatively allowed.
- Link Monsters

## Rule 3: Monster Zones
There are no Extra Monster zones, nor are there any extra limitations on summoning of monsters from the Extra Deck.

## Rule 4: Forbidden + Limited Lists
