# YGOTAS Companion
An Android application that displays Yu-Gi-Oh The Abridged Series (and other Yu-Gi-Oh content) quotes and sound clips, allowing the user to interact and play them from a single app. Also contains features displaying custom house rules, aids for a duel in progress and other Yu-Gi-Oh related features. Intended for personal use.

*Note: This application was developed almost entirely using Jetpack Compose, and is also the first Jetpack Compose application created by a Firmware Engineer who is mostly unfamiliar with modern app development practices. If there is strange code smells or behavior, it is likely unintended and a side effect of an engineer stepping out of his comfort zone.*
